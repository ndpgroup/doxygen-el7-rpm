Subject: [PATCH] DO NOT hardcode x86-64 architecture.

doxygen built on most of architectures by pure luck and order of Qt5
qatomics_arch.h header where check for QT_ARCH_X86_64 was *after* most
of other architectures.

But not after AArch64 where it failed due to attempt of using x86-64
atomics code.
